BEAUTI 
====
A mobile web app made for our intro HCI course at UCSD (COGS 120/CSE 170). Recommends new looks and video tutorials to follow based on user's existing makeup products.
====

Do you struggle with finding all the products used in a makeup tutorial?
Do you wish there was a way to record your improvements as a makeup enthusiast?
Input the products you own, and our app BEAUTI will generate tutorials tailored to your personal collection. BEAUTI also acts as a creative lookbook, where you can upload pictures of your finished makeup looks, and have access to past creations to view your progress.
